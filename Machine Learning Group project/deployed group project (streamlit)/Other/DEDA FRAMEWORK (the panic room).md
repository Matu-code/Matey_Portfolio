#  STEP 2: #
Read each question and answer it.

Q1.Project name, date, place?

Project name - The Crime Crystal Ball.
    
Date - 25/05/2023

Place - Breda University of Applied Sciences, Breda.


Q2. Participants of the project?
The Panic Room - Hubert Waleńczak, Matey Nedyalkov, Raphaël van Rijn, Maikel Boezer , Amy Suneeth.



Q3. What is the project about and what is its goal?

The primary objective of the project is to assist the municipality of Breda in improving the standard of quality of life for its residents. Our team is focusing on the crime rates of Breda and hence creating a prediction model for predicting crimes. This model will involve some factors such as unemployment rates, education and income from different neighborhoods of Breda.


Q4. What kind of data will you be using?

We will be using different data such as the crime rates in Breda per year, unemployment rates, education and income.

Q5. Who might be affected by the project.

People with low income, people with low to no education and unemployed people.


Q6. What are the benefits of the project?
What are the problems or concerns that might arise in connection with this project?

The project is intended to help the municipality to increase the quality of life for it's residents. The main problems that we might have to deal with will be the lack of required data to create a prediction model.

Q7. Does the project make use of an algorithm, or some form of 
machine learning?

Yes

Q8. Is there someone within the team that can explain how the algorithm 
 or neural networks? If not, go to ‘Source.’
in question works?

Yes

No

Q13. Who has access to the encryption key to de-pseudonymize the data?

It is open source data.


## Visualization ##

Map of Breda with their classifications and factors.

## Access ##

Q16. Who has access to the data and under what conditions?

Everyone has access to this data since it is open sourced and accessible to anyone who wants to look into it.


## Sharing, Reusing and Re purposing ##

Q17. Are any of the data suitable for reuse? If so, under what 
conditions and for what (new) purpose(s) could they be reused?

All the data that we are using are reusable and can be used to make different models of prediction using the same.


Q18. Are there any obligations (not) to make the data publicly available? 
If you were to provide open access to parts of the data, 
what opportunities and risks might arise?

Since the data is open and accessible to everyone there is no obligation not to make the data publicly unavailable. There won't be any risks involved when it comes to providing open access to the data that we are using since it is already open and available for everyone to see.


## Responsibility ##

Q19. Which laws and regulations apply to your project?

For this project we are implementing the GDPR ethical guidelines. GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation. It is a comprehensive data protection law that was implemented in the European Union. The GDPR aims to safeguard the privacy and personal data of individuals within the EU and regulates how organizations collect, process, and handle such data.  

Q20. Who is ultimately responsible for the project? 
The project manager for our group is Raphael. However, everyone within our group is equally responsible for everything regarding the project. 

Q21. Are the duties and responsibilities of that person clear, with regard to this project.
Yes. We have made sure to ensure that we follow the GDPR guidelines. We have also tried to make our work transparent and understandable for everyone.

`Q22. Is the project suitable for cooperation with (commercial) partners?`
`If so, which parties could that be.`
`Yes the project is suitable for cooperation with commercial partners, it means that the project has attributes or characteristics that make it appealing and beneficial for collaboration with businesses or organizations in the commercial sector and since we are trying to help the municipality, I would definitely say that this is true.`


 ## Communication ##

Q23. What is the communication strategy with regard to this project? 
Are all parties involved in agreement as to this strategy?

We actively engage in regular meetings with our partners, incorporating their valuable feedback to refine our strategies and enhance the outlook of our project. 


Q24. What communication strategies are there for cases in which something goes 
wrong, and who is responsible for them.
If something goes wrong, we first talk to our mentor, who will then tell us what can be done to overcome our issues.

## Transparency ##

Q25. Does the project risk generating public concern or outrage? 
No. Only for criminals :)

Q26. How transparent are you about this project towards citizens?

All the data is open source and everyone will know what factors will be embedded in our unsupervised machine learning model. So, yes, the project is very transparent towards citizens.

Q27. Do citizens have the opportunity to raise objections to the results of the project?

 As our project operates in collaboration with the municipality, they serve as a primary point of contact for inquiries and feedback. This professional channel ensures a transparent and accountable process for addressing any issues related to our project.

Q28. Can citizens opt out of their involvement in the project? 
If so, when and how can they do this?

This is not possible since we have not collected any kind of personal information and our data is mostly on a neighborhood level. So it would very unlikely for any one person/citizen to have objections.

## 	Privacy ##

Q29. Is there a data protection officer or data privacy officer involved in this project.
We do not have any data protection officer. However we actively ensure to follow the guidelines.

Have you conducted a PIA (Privacy Impact Assessment) 
or DPIA (Data Protection Impact Assessment)?

Since we are not using any personal information for this project, it is not necessary for us to conduct these guidelines. We however ensure to follow the ethical guidelines mentioned in the GDPR framework.


Q30. Does this project make use of personal data? If not, continue with “Bias."
No.

Q31 As a member of the project, what outcomes do you expect?
I expect us to have a machine learning model and a dashboard containing all the information that we used along with analysis for the same.


Q32. Is there anything about this project that makes you uneasy?
No.


Q33. Will the results of the analysis be evaluated by a human before being implemented?
Yes - The municipality.

No.

Q37. Are you gathering the information that is appropriate for the purpose of your project?
Yes.

Q38. Is there a risk that the project will unintentionally create incentives for 
undesirable behavior?
Yes.This may happen if we are able to find out the areas with higher crimes and if the municipality is able to do something about it, the people who get caught might have incentives for undesirable behavior.

#  STEP 3:  #

` Which values and principles are important to you personally, and which are important to your organization?`

When working on a project that involves data, I make an effort to follow the fundamental principles that guarantee responsible and moral data handling. In order to protect the confidentiality and integrity of personal information, I place a high priority on upholding privacy rights. 
Fortunately, the values that are important to me personally are the values that the organization i.e. my team follows. This also includes ensuring that all information that we collected has to follow the GDPR guidelines. 

`Are the values and principles you have written down represented in the answers you have formulated?`

Yes.
