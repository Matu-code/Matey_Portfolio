# Introducing The Crime Crystal Ball
a cutting-edge machine learning model made to Improve the crime-fighting field by prediction and prevention. In today’s society and economy, ensuring safety and security on the street is more important and challenging than ever. By using machine learning and data analytics, The Crime Crystal Ball works to provide crime prevention services and make them stay on top of their game. We do this by giving them more insights into how we try to predict the ever-changing future. Our aim in this project is to prioritize fairness and transparency, seeing as these are essential when working with our ethical considerations. We want to keep our model’s biases mitigated and make sure that there is equity for all the communities that might be affected by our product.

## The Machine learning lifecycle
This file will document everything related to the product, its lifecycle, and the product iterations. 
### Data
Data used in the project is open-sourced and available to the public from the municipality of Breda and the Central Bureau of Statistics.
Data has been cleaned by splitting, combining, and renaming columns as well as transforming data into a more machine-friendly format. After Exploratory Data Analysis was performed to better understand available information, findings proved that the original idea was not feasible and a new one needed to be drafted. 

The new project is supposed to utilise machine learning to analyse the influence of different factors on crime rates in neighbourhoods on a yearly scale. The year 2019 has been chosen for training the model as this year provides the most data and the Covid outbreak happened at the end of the year so it is a non-factor.

## The ethical frameworks
we filled in the ALTAI and DEDA farmeworks to make sure that we did this project ethically, and did not break any rules. The DEDA framework can be found [here](https://github.com/BredaUniversityADSAI/2022-23d-1fcmgt-reg-ai-01-group-team3/blob/main/Other/DEDA%20framework%20(%20final%20).pdf) and the ALTAI framework can be found [here](https://github.com/BredaUniversityADSAI/2022-23d-1fcmgt-reg-ai-01-group-team3/blob/main/Other/Ethical%20framework.pdf).
