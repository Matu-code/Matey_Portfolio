Data Science Portfolio

# Project 1: Interactive Power Bi Dashboard - Analysing the pollution in China and India (individual)
- The project goal was to choose a topic from SDG (Sustainable Development Goals) and do interactive dashboard on Power BI.
- Data was collected to be performed the analysis.
- The dashboard was created to be intuitive for using as the design is minimalistic.

# Project 2: Machine Learning Regression Algorithm - Predicting the rating of a TV show (individual)
- We, the students from BUas, were hired from Banijay to perform analysis and machine learning algorithm.
- The goal was to find the best features, which could help improving the rating of a show.
- Data analysis was performed with the help of Pandas and visualisations libraries (matplotlib, seaborn and bookeh) as the data was preprocessed and visualized.
- Machine learning algorithms were made as for the purpose of the project the most appropriate option was a regressor (Linear Regression and Decion tree regressor).
- Report was drafted for the project as there was described how the project was done and also the ethical aspects of it.

# Project 3: Deep Learning Image Classification Algorithm - Identifying birds and flowers (individual)
- Our mentors from university hired us as freelancers to create an image classification project along with prototype and marketing research.
- Marketing research was done to make sure that the application is going to be actually useable.
- I created a binary neural network, which can make the difference between birds and flowers (with the idea to be able to recognize different species of birds and flowers in the future).
- I created CNN with tensorflow keras as I also used data augmentation and transfer learning for my project.
- Prototype was created on Proto.io.

# Project 4: Machine Learning Classification Algorithm - Identifying crime rates in different neighbourhoods in Breda (group)
- The last block of the year we were divided into groups to make a project for the manucipality of Breda.
- We created an application, which predicts the crime rate in different neighbourhoods in Breda as clustering and classification algorithms were used.
- I was mostly responsible for the preprocessing and visualizing the data as I also drafted a data quality report.
- I also part of creating the clustering and classification model as I performed hyperparameter tuning with the help of Optuna.
- I helped for the deployment of the project as my main role here was only the page for the data analysis.

# Project 5: Analytics Translator - Working with one of the study programs of BUas (facility management) and giving solutions on how to integrate AI.
- Working with stakeholders to understand their goals, objectives, strategies, challenges and needs;
- Collecting, cleaning and analyze data to identify trends, patterns and insight relevant to the project as it was used R;
- Implementing mixed-method research - both qualitative and quantitative;
- Conducting personal research on the impact of predictive maintenance;
- Writing policy paper in a team on how to integrate AI in the facility management program.

# Project 6: Artificial Intelligence scientist - computer vision and robotics
- Using traditional CV techniques to preprocess images;
- Using traditional CV and deep learning models to identify the tips of the roots;
- Working with robotics environment, so it can guide it to drop water on the tip of the roots;
- Using reinforcement learning and traditional controller methods to guide the robot to its targets.

# Project 7: Artificial Intelligence scientist - Natural Language Processing
- Learning preprocessing techniques such as tokenization and stemming to preprocess text data;
- Implementing word embedding to get vector representations for the data;
- Implementing models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, RNN and Transformer learning for reaching the goal of the project;
- Applying speech-to-text model using speechrecognition library;
- Writing technical report for the whole project (team work) as I was responsible for the data part.
